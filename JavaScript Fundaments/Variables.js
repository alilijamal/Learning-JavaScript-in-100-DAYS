//Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:
    //An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
    //A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.


//The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:
let message;
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message


//The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:
alert(message); // shows the variable content

//We can also declare multiple variables in one line:
let user = 'John', age = 25, messages = 'Hello';
